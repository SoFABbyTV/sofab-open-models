[Version Beta 0.18 RC1] - 08/05/2015

In this minor release we have fixed a few issues in the previous release and added a tool that forces a re-flash of the scanner's firmware.

We expect to make another major release soon, which will include further improvements to alignment.

Changes since Beta 0.17
=======================
- Fixed turntable removal bug (turntable removal changes were not being reflected in the final point cloud / mesh)
- Removed White Balance control, this should be an internal parameter.
- Switched White Balance to automatic mode, this means that objects scanned should now appear to be their correct colour i.e. without the purple/pink haze over them
- Changed camera settings GUI to include sliders.
- Added a tool to force an upgrade of firmware - please ensure no other device (except mice/keyboards) are connected when doing this.

Notices
=======
- Please ensure you have the latest graphics drivers installed for your card, otherwise the application may shut down when the alignment window appears.
- If you are running Windows 7, please install the serial drivers here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/10uq2boz7rb8s97/FTDIDrivers.zip?dl=0
- If the camera produces a pink hue or black screen when connected, please re-connect the scanner (both USB and power).
- If a scanned object looks very lumpy or wavy, try increasing the image stack size in the Scan Settings window that appears before scanning.
- If features are missing from an object, try increasing the number of Turns in the Scan Settings window that appears before scanning.

Current Limitations
===================
- Application supports 64-bit only.
- Application is supported on Windows 7 and Windows 8 only. We will produce Mac and Linux ports in a future release.
- "Very High" resolution mode is currently disabled. This will be enabled in a future release.
- The top camera is currently disabled. This will be enabled in a future release.
